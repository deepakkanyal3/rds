To SSH into your VirtualBox VM from your macOS host machine through a VPN, you'll need to set up port forwarding in VirtualBox so that you can reach the VM from your host machine. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. Configure Port Forwarding in VirtualBox
Open VirtualBox Manager and select your VM.

Click on Settings.

Go to the Network section.

Ensure the Attached to: setting is set to NAT.

Click on the Advanced drop-down.

Click on Port Forwarding.

In the Port Forwarding Rules window, you need to add a new rule:

Name: SSH (or any name you prefer)
Protocol: TCP
Host IP: (leave this blank or set to 127.0.0.1)
Host Port: 2222 (or any port that you want to use on your host machine)
Guest IP: (leave this blank)
Guest Port: 22 (default SSH port)
Click OK to close the Port Forwarding Rules window and OK again to close the VM settings.

2. SSH into Your VM from macOS
Open Terminal on your macOS host machine.

Use the SSH command to connect to the VM. The command should look something like this:

bash
Copy code
ssh -p 2222 username@localhost
-p 2222 specifies the port you set in the Port Forwarding rules.
username is the user account you want to use to log into your VM.
localhost refers to your local machine.
Troubleshooting
Ensure your VM is running and that SSH is enabled on the VM.
Verify firewall settings on both macOS and the VM to make sure they allow SSH connections.
If you have trouble connecting, double-check the port forwarding settings to ensure the correct ports are being used.
This setup forwards traffic from your local machine’s port (e.g., 2222) to the VM’s SSH port (22), allowing you to connect to the VM as if you were connecting directly.
